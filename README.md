Word_cloud graph using text mining 


happy Canada day  
I was looking for  an exciting project to share, 
Years and years, I was looking for such a graph regarding my conferences/presentations and speeches. It was my biggest challenge, how to start! For each presentation, I had to spend some hours to find an appropriated figure, but I didn't like it. A couple of months ago, for one of my NLP projects, I learned how to use text mining for data visualization. So fascinating, isn't it :)
If you have the same problem, well you are more than welcome to use my codes :) 
happy codding 

Library : 
Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, PIL, wordcloud
